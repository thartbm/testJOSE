# Neuromatch Academy: a 3-week, online summer school in computational neuroscience

## Summary

Neuromatch Academy ([*https://neuromatch.io/academy)*](https://neuromatch.io/academy) was designed as an online summer school to cover the basics of computational neuroscience in three weeks. The materials cover dominant and emerging computational neuroscience tools, how they complement one another, and specifically focus on how they can help us to better understand how the brain functions. An original component of the materials is its focus on modeling choices, i.e. how do we choose the right approach, how do we build models, and how can we evaluate models to determine if they provide real (meaningful) insight. This meta-modeling component of the instructional materials asks what questions can be answered by different techniques, and how to apply them meaningfully to get insight about brain function.

Each day constitutes one teaching module and covers one topic in computational neuroscience (see table 1). While the content is organized as a 3-week crash-course (+ 2 optional Python introduction days) of consecutive teaching modules that build on one another, it can be rolled out at any pace, in its entirety or as stand-alone parts (provided prerequisites for each part are met). Materials consist of highly curated recorded lectures and tutorials, organized in ‘days’, as well as 5 data sets for group projects. Most days can be used as separate, independent modules and can, for example, be combined with other instructional content. To facilitate this, we not only provide general prerequisites for the entire course but also daily topic-specific prerequisites (see appendix 1). The material is meant to either be taught to small groups of ~10 attendees guided by a teaching assistant, for instruction in a classroom, or for usage in other (potentially for-profit) events. As such the material is largely self sufficient and could be used for self-study.

|         **Week 1**               |         **Week 2**             |         **Week 3**        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| W1D1  _Model Types_              | W2D1  _Bayesian Statistics_    | W3D1  _Real Neurons_      |
| W1D2  _Modeling Practice_        | W2D2  _Linear Systems_         | W3D2  _Dynamic Networks_  |
| W1D3  _Model Fitting_            | W2D3  _Decision Making_        | W3D3  _Network Causality_ |

| W1D5  _Dimensionality Reduction_ | W2D5  _Reinforcement Learning_ | W3D5  _Deep Learning 2_   |

**Table 1. Neuromatch Academy Topics.** _Organized chronologically by week (W) and day of week (D), e.g. week 2 day 4 = W2D4. In addition, there are two days of preparatory instruction in coding Python, the materials for which can be found in W0D1._

Each instruction module (day) consists of 1) an introductory lecture (~30 minutes) that broaches the topic to students and explains the general approach, followed by 2) hands-on tutorials in the form of several ipython notebooks (~3 hours) with code-completion assignments and answers, and further instruction through embedded micro-lectures, and finally 3) an outro lecture (~30 minutes) to recapitulate the covered material and provide an outlook on its applicability to neuroscience research. All lectures and tutorials are available online [permalink]. Each day is meant to instruct the basics of a given topic and further readings are supplied.

For attendees to apply what they learn, we also provide materials for individual or group projects and five curated data sets (see table 2) to use for these projects, including videos describing the data and ipython notebooks to get started.

| **Data set**          | **Contains**          | **Possible projects** |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Stringer data | activity from ~10,000 V1 neurons, recorded with calcium imaging from a mouse in total darkness | discover structure of cortical column; relate activity to spontaneous behavior |
| Steinmetz data | neuropixels recording (waveforms, task events, spikes) in mice doing a visual discrimination task | predict task performance from neural data; reconstruct face, eye or paw movement from neural data |
| Kay/Gallant data | fMRI during viewing of natural images | reconstruct or predict images from brain activity in separate regions |
| HCP data | fMRI time series in 7 tasks and resting state for 340 human participants, and percellation in ROIs | identify a set of brain areas differentially involved in various tasks |
| IBL data | very large behavioral data of mice doing a visual detection task with a bias | fit models to predict the choice of the animal; model individual differences |

## Statement of Need

### Need for training

Neuroscience makes use of a broad range of computational techniques, but very few institutions have enough local expertise to provide meaningful instruction in all of them. As a result, most computational neuroscience researchers around the world lack appropriate training and we aim to provide that here. Additionally, by focussing on meta-modeling, i.e. which method to apply in which situation, we assure that computational methods will be used in such a way as to lead to meaningful new insights into brain function.

### Need for accessible materials

Neuroscience, like any academic discipline, struggles to be more diverse and inclusive, in the social sense. We aim to remove some of the barriers to good educational materials for computational neuroscience. By making the material freely available online, we make them available to anyone worldwide; we thus remove the need to be part of geographically restricted, rich, prestigious institutions to gain access to high-level training (e.g. the notebooks have been mirrored on gitee and videos on bilibili to make the material more accessible in China). Freely accessible materials should also alleviate negative effects of systemic biases and gatekeeping leading to discrimination in access to resources. A further step towards increased diversity is made by having diverse lecturers who may serve as role models. Finally, we have added captions in English and translated them in Mandarin and Spanish for both people with hearing difficulties and those who are not fluent in English (YouTube metrics indicate ~35% of views use captions). While our efforts do not achieve full inclusivity and diversity in neuroscience, we believe it is a step in the right direction.

## Experience

A first step in building an accessible content base was to recruit a pool of lecturers and content creators with an eye towards maximizing diversity in dimensions such as gender, race and career status. This helps to reduce intrinsic forms of bias within the lectures and exercises, and also helps to broadcast the accessibility of the discipline to a wider audience.

The materials (intro, outro and micro-lectures as well as tutorials) went through several instances of quality control, before we used it in our own summer school. First, a group of content reviewers provided feedback on the material which was integrated by the primary content creators. Second, a group of skilled programmers served as tutorial editors who went through the tutorials to review and edit code and make sure it all adhered to our standards. For example, they made sure code was as simple as possible and that all plots used the same look. Third, two separate groups of content testers independently went through all the material as if they were students, providing feedback to tutorial writers who integrated this feedback. They reported errors and omissions and provided pedagogical advice on confusing or misleading parts to the rest of the team. They also made sure the micro-lectures connected with the material in the tutorials. For example, we made sure the hands-on tutorials are do-able within the time frame, while providing bonus materials for faster attendees. After this step, videos of lectures were finalized. Fourth, the tutorial and code editors once again made sure all tutorials worked, used the same style and connected with the rest of the material. For future rounds of our summer school, we also had content testers provide structured feedback on the material during the actual summer school, and about ~90% of attendees and TA’s filled in end-of-day surveys during the actual summer school. We will use this feedback to further improve the materials. The most recent version can be found on GitHub ([*https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/)*](https://github.com/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content).

Our quality-control processes ensured that the course content was well received. During the summer of 2020, we taught the Neuromatch Academy material to 1757 interactive students in 64 countries with 191 teaching assistants. There were also ~6000 registered observer students (more according to YouTube analytics). The summer school ran 24/7 across all timezones with no major glitches. The percentage of interactive students that completed at least 50% of classes was 86%. Of all end-of-day survey respondents, 94% would recommend NMA to a friend.

## Acknowledgements

The Neuromatch Academy summer school also crucially relied on many teaching assistants, mentors and people organizing the community. Many of these people provided valuable feedback which will be used to improve the material and experience in coming summer schools. We wish to thank everyone involved in making NMA a success!
